Versioning
==========

Note: the version of the `coda` library in Haskell is prefixed with `0.` relative to the version of the
Visual Studio Code language extension. This is required to meet the [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/) requirements for `cabal`, and the
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) required by Visual Studio Code, while keeping the versions in sync.

The version numbers shown below are semantic version numbers.

## 0.1.0
