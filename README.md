[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/coda.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/coda)

This package provides a toy compiler for experimenting with resumable parsing, which is designed as a plugin for Visual Studio Code.

Installation
============

To build:

1. Make sure you have `npm` and `Visual Studio Code` installed and that `code` from the command line will invoke visual studio code.

2. If you would like to avoid affecting your global environment, you can choose to run

```
$ cabal sandbox
```

or set up a local `stack` configuration.

3. Just

```
$ cabal install
```

to register the extension with Visual Studio. Alternately, you can `cabal build` then 

4. 

4. Install the resulting `dist/build/coda-<version>.vsix` file by opening Visual Studio Code, then hitting
   `âŒ˜-Shift-P` then selecting

```
> Extensions: Install Extension from VSIX
```

and selecting the file.

To side-step this process for active development on the compiler, you can try to symlink the client
directory directly into Visual Studio Code with

```
$ make dirty
```

and then just build in place.

The instructions in [Running and Debugging Your Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/debugging-extensions)
can be readily tweaked to work here if you need more interactive debugging support when working on the compiler.

Requirements
============

Currently, the build process is being tested on GHC 8.0, but I'm not actively doing anything to shut off older GHCs or newer ones.

Patches that help increase portability are welcome.
